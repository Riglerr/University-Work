architecture

1. For real world, client-server ,saas (cloud based)
2. for this project, recommend a stand-alone platform as there is no website &
    simplicity

Database
Depends on language
Java: oracle & ogreSql
c#,c++: Access & MySQL

UI

Recommend Java or c#, both have very easy implementations of databases & SQL

c# can utilize visual studio gui builder & data source integration

Java has Swing which is harder than using a GUI tool like VS, but if we're using
    an oracle based system then this is the way to go.

C++ will make life very difficult in terms of database integration, unless using
  an older version of VS, which might prove more problematic for modularity and
  compatibility of split workload.

python: don't even think about it.
