MULTIPROGRAMMING

	Takes advantage of I/O requests to maximise CPU usage.
	
	The system starts executing a process, at some point this process will  need to wait 
	on another task (most commonly I/O). At this point, the CPU switches to another job that 
	is ready to be executed while the other process is waiting.
	When the initial process is no longer waiting for I/O, it is then switched back over to the CPU 
	for execution.
	Maximises CPU ---> Always processes running.
MULTITASKING (time-sharing)

	Gives each process a share of the CPU time, giving the impression of several
	programs running at once.
	
	Processes in main memory are switched on and off the CPU quickly.
	Each process gets a certain amount of time on the CPU, then the next is swapped in.
	Makes it look like their going all at once.
	
	
	
	
			SCHEDULING

Two levels of scheduling:

			Job scheduling - From secondary storage to Main memory.
			CPU scheduling - From Main Memory to CPU.
			
			
	The Job Queue - Represents all processes on system (secondary storage).
	The Ready Queue - Process in main memory that are ready to execute (in a 'ready' state)
						Process is dispatched from ready queue for processing ('running' state).
