For task 1: I reserved the first element in DATA[] to hold the count.
  #define COUNT_POS 0.

Then increase buffer length by 1 to accommodate count position.

Then enclosed the consumer code in an if/else.
if the buffer not full, consumer can take data,
if not, then consumer signals to producer.

Did the same with producer.
