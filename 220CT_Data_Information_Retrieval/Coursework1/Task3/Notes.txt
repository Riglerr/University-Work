issues to be considered:

		The hospital must require consent from all of it patients to collect
		& distribute data.
		If consent is not granted, then the data has been acquired unlawfully.
		Consent can be given via oral or written communication, but usually is given 
		via a consent form which details the transaction.
	
	Confidentiality
		If the customer has stated that they do not want their data to be shared with 
		third parties, Then it is required for the hospital to not share the data.
		
	Protection
		Pateients must be protected by not disclosing their sensitive data.
	
	Inform
		Patients must be informed how the data will be obtained,processed & shared 
		prior to obtaining consent.
