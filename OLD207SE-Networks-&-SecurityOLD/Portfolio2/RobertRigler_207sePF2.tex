\begin{homeworkProblem}[Week 12: Multitasking vs Multiprogramming]
	
	In this task I am going to be comparing two different types of process scheduling: Multitasking, and Multiprogramming. I will look into what they are, their differences and their similarities.
	
	\subsubsection{Multiprogramming}
	 
	\textbf{Definition:} A way of scheduling processes to maximise CPU usage by switching processes that are 'waiting' for I/O, it ensures that the CPU is never idle.\\
	
	Much older systems, unlike modern computers were very expensive and slow and often, when a process needed to use a peripheral device It often meant that the CPU was sitting idle for a long period of time. The solution to this is 'batch processing'.
	
	Multiprogramming allows a computer to do several tasks at the same time. When a group of processes are marked 'Ready' for execution they are placed in a queue in main memory. The first process from this queue is then loaded into the CPU and is executed. There may come a time when this process is interrupted because It needs I/O to continue. At this point the process changed to a 'waiting' state. The process is then swapped out of the CPU into the I/O queue, and the next process in the 'Ready Queue' is swapped into the CPU. When the I/O request of the first process is completed, it is then placed back into the 'Ready queue'.
	
	This cycle continues until there are no jobs to be processed.
	
	\subsubsection{Multitasking}
	
	\textbf{Definition:} A logical extension of Multiprogramming, it involves rapidly switching between processed in the 'Ready state' to give the impression that they are all running simultaneously.\\
	
	In Multiprogramming, processes are executing one at a time, in the order that they are placed into the ready queue. This means that only one process can be actively used at a time. Similarly in multitasking, processes are executed individually, but ther is also a certain level of concurrency; Because once a process has used it allotted processing time, It is swapped back into main memory.
	
	This is beneficial, because with multiprogramming, a process has complete control over the CPU until an interrupt is called. There may be a situation where a process does not call an interrupt and takes a long time to finish processing. This will cause shorter, more time efficient or more important processes to be delayed until the first process is finished.

\begin{homeworkProblem}[Week 14: Process Manipulation \& Nohup]
\begin{homeworkSection}{Process Manipulation}
For this task I will look into the different ways to manipulate a process, and show examples of how to use each command.

\vspace{1cm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline \textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
\textit{command} & Type the name of the process to start it \\ \hline
\textit{command \&} & Start the process in the background (symbolised by the \& symbol)\\ \hline
\textit{ps -au} & Shows all the processes currently running on the machine \\ \hline
\textit{ps -ux} & Shows all the processes currently running owned by the current user \\ \hline
\textit{jobs} & Shows the processs that are currently suspended. \\ \hline
\textit{CTRL - C} & Kills the process running in the foreground \\ \hline
\textit{kill -9 \textit{x}} & Kills the process with the PID \textit{x} \\ \hline
\textit{kill \%1} & Kills the process with job number \textit{1} \\ \hline
\textit{CTRL - Z} & Susoends the process curently running in the foreground. \\ \hline
\textit{kill -cont \%1} & Continues the execution of suspended job \%1 \\ \hline
\textit{bg \%1} & Pushes job number 1 to to the background \\ \hline
\textit{fg \%1} & Pushes job number 1 to to the foreground \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

In the pages below, I will show two scenarios in which I use all of these commands. You will find a snippet of terminal code and an explanation of each step that was taken.

\vspace{1cm}
\pagebreak
\Cscript{Week14/command}{Scenario 1}
\textbf{This typescript recording shows how I: }\\
\begin{enumerate}

\item Starting the process \textit{xclock} in the foreground,\\ 
\item Suspending \textit{xclock} via CTRL-z,\\ \hfill
\item Bringing \textit{xclock} back to the foreground using \textit{fg \%1}\\ \hfill
\item Finally Killing the process with CTRL-C\\ \hfill
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak
\Cscript{Week14/comm2}{Scenario 2}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting the \textit{xclock} process in the background,\\
\item Starting another \textit{xclock} process in the foreground,\\
\item Suspend the \textit{xclock} foreground process using CTRL-Z,\\
\item Use the Jobs Keyword to show the two \textit{xclock} processes,\\
\item Kill the first \textit{xclock} job using kill \%1\\
\item Continue the second \textit{xclock} process in the foreground using kill -cont \%2\\
\item Show a list of my running processes using ps -au | grep rob\\
\item Finally Kill the remaining \textit{xclock} process by using kill -9 21813
\end{enumerate}


\end{homeworkSection}

\begin{homeworkSection}{Nohup}

\textbf{Definition} : A command which allows a process to continue executing after the parent process has been stopped.\\
'Nohup' means 'No Hang Up'. Commands that are executed with 'nohup', ignore hang up signals, so that the user can log out of the terminal and the process will still be running in the background.
When a process is run in the foreground (no \&), it effectively blocks the use of the shell whilst that process is being executed. When a process is run in the background (with \&), it is placed into the list of background jobs that the shell is managing, but it is still connected to that shell, so if the shell closes, the process is terminated. NOHUP effictively separates the command from the shell, allowing it to close and the process to continue.\\
In this example, I am going to use the 'spotify' process as an example. \\
If I type 'spotify \&', the spotify application is started and is run in the background, allowing to continue using the shell. When I use the 'jobs' command , we can see that the spotify process is running in the background.

\vspace {0.5cm}
\includegraphics[scale =0.3]{Week14/nohup1.png} \\When I exit the shell, the 'spotify' application also closes.\\ \hfill
\pagebreak
Now, if I type 'nohup spotify \&' and look at the terminal jobs. It shows 'nohup spotify \& ' , but now if I type exit, the application will stay open regardless of the terminal.
